👋 Hi, I’m Ayush — a backend engineer with 7+ years of experience working across PHP, Python, and Golang.

⚙️ I’ve worked on legacy systems, built scalable services, and contributed to programmatic ad platforms (e.g., Kaden AI). Currently not working anywhere and exploring my interests.

🧠 Currently exploring distributed computing over LAN using phones and PCs.

🛠️ I enjoy low-level stuff — from x86_64 assembly to reverse engineering, building game in C, custom memory allocator and deallocator and system design.
