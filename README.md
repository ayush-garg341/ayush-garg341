# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayush Garg

**Backend / Systems Engineer | 7+ years experience | Python - C - Php - Go**

I build software that cares about **performance, correctness, and how things actually work under the hood**.

I've spent most of my career working on **real-world production systems** from legacy codebases to scalable backend services and I enjoy digging into problems that sit close to the OS, memory, and networking layers.

---
## 🧠 What I'm into right now
- Doing CTFs from pwn.college and learning cybersecurity.
- Exploring concurrency models, task scheduling, and resource sharing ( learning OS by implementing them )
- Reverse engineering & understanding systems from first principles  
---
## 🛠️ What I enjoy working on
- Backend systems & APIs that scale and fail gracefully  
- Breaking the systems
- Debugging **performance & memory issues** (the fun kind 😄)  
- Low-level programming:
  - x86_64 assembly
  - Custom memory allocators / deallocators
  - File I/O, buffering, caching strategies
- Systems design with a strong bias for **simplicity & observability**
- Occasionally building games & experiments in **C**
---
## 💼 Experience highlights
- 7+ years building and maintaining backend systems  
- Worked extensively with **Python, PHP and Golang**  
- Experience with **programmatic advertising platforms** (e.g. Kaden AI)  
- Comfortable navigating and modernizing **large legacy codebases**  
- Strong at reading unfamiliar code and making it behave

## 🧰 Tech I work with
**Languages**  
`PHP` · `Python` · `Golang` · `C`

**Systems & Concepts**  
`Linux` - `Networking` - `Concurrency` - `Memory Management` - 
`Async I/O` - `Caching` - `Profiling` - `Debugging`

**Tools**  
`Docker` - `Redis` - `Nginx` - `Git` - `curl` - `strace` - `gdb`

## 🚀 What I’m looking for
I’m currently **independent and exploring**, open to:
- Backend / systems roles  
- Performance-critical systems  
- Infra, distributed systems, or low-level problem spaces  

If the problem involves *"this shouldn't be slow, but it is"*, I’m interested.
